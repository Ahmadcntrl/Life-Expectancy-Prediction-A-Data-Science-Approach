## Life Expectancy Prediction: Socio-Economic & Health Factors Analysis
This project investigates how socio-economic and health indicators influence global life expectancy through data science techniques. Using Python's data stack, I:

🔍 Performed comprehensive EDA to uncover relationships between life expectancy and factors like GDP, schooling, and adult mortality   
📊 Created insightful visualizations to communicate key patterns in the data    
🤖 Built and evaluated a linear regression model with:

Feature engineering to optimize predictive power  

5-fold cross-validation for robust performance assessment   

R² score evaluation (achieved 98% accuracy)   
📉 Analyzed residuals and predictions to diagnose model behavior   
💡 Provided actionable recommendations for both model improvement and policy insights   

Tech Stack: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn), VSCode
